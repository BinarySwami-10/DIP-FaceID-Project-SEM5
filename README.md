# What is Face Recognition
A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital 
image or a video frame against a database of faces, typically employed to authenticate users through 
ID verification services, works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.
While initially a form of computer application, facial recognition systems have seen wider uses
in recent times on smartphones and in other forms of technology, such as robotics. Because computerized 
facial recognition involves the measurement of a human's physiological characteristics facial recognition 
systems are categorised as biometrics. Although the accuracy of facial recognition systems as a biometric 
technology is lower than iris recognition and fingerprint recognition, it is widely adopted due to its
contactless and non-invasive process.[1] Facial recognition systems have been deployed in advanced 
human-computer interaction, video surveillance and automatic indexing of images.[2] 

# How It Works
Face recognition systems use computer algorithms to pick out specific, 
distinctive details about a person’s face. These details, such as distance
between the eyes or shape of the chin, are then converted into a mathematical 
representation and compared to data on other faces collected in a face recognition 
database. The data about a particular face is often called a face template and is 
distinct from a photograph because it’s designed to only include certain details
that can be used to distinguish one face from another. 

Some face recognition systems, instead of positively identifying
an unknown person, are designed to calculate a probability match
score between the unknown person and specific face templates stored
in the database. These systems will offer up several potential matches,
ranked in order of likelihood of correct identification, instead of just
returning a single result. 

Face recognition systems vary in their ability to identify people under challenging conditions such as poor lighting, low quality image resolution, and suboptimal angle of view (such as in a photograph taken from above looking down on an unknown person).

# About FaceID History
Face ID is a facial recognition system designed and developed by Apple Inc.
for the iPhone (X, XS, XS Max, XR, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, 12 Mini, 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max)
and iPad Pro (third and fourth generation). A successor to Touch ID, the system allows 
biometric authentication for unlocking a device,[1] making payments, and accessing sensitive
data, as well as providing detailed facial expression tracking for Animoji and other features.
Initially released in November 2017 with the iPhone X, it has since been updated and 
introduced to most new iPhone models, and all iPad Pro models.[2]
